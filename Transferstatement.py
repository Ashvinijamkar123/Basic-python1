# i=0
# if i<20:
#     pass
# else:
#     print("i is greater than 20")

## 2) continue statement:
# l=[11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88]
# for i in l:
#     if i==33:
#         continue
#     print(i)

## 3) break statement:
# l=[11,22,33,44,55]
# for i in l:
#     if i==44:
#         break
#     print(i)
